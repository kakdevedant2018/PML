Stratifies K-Fold Cross validation is variation of k-fold cross validation 
with an equal proportion of data in all folds. It solves the problem of 
k-fold cross validation by returning stratified folds: each set contains approximately 
the same percentage of samples of each target class.

cross-validation solves the drawback of train_test_split.
