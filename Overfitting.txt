is when a ml model begins to learn specifics of the training data instead of genralizing
to new data.

machine learning algorithm becomes too specific to the training data and doesn't 
generalize well to new data.

This can cause inaccurate predictions.

In a nutshell overfitting happens when your model learn the noise in your data rahter than
the actual patterns.
	like outliers,missing values and extra features
