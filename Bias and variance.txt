Bias---


	It is the  phenomenon that skews the result of an algorithm in favour or against
		an idea .

	High bias causes Underfitting of the model.
	
	Bias error comes up when an algorithm makes incorrect assumptions about the 
	relationship between the features and target variable in the training data




if data is performing good with model then we will say----- low Bias 
 and if not we will  say -----High bias.




Variance ---- 



	Variance refers to the changes into the model jwhen using different portion 
	of the training or test data.
	
Variance error is caused by over-sensitivity to minute fluctuations in the training data.
	 Due to this, the model learns noise from the data.

	High variance causes overfitting of the model.


if good accuracy --- low variance
 bad accuracy -----  high variance




The model do mistakes while predicting becoz of numerous reasons.
These mistakes are bias and variance.

overfitting:- In this case the model tries to memorize all the data you give

Underfitting:- It doesn't learn much from the data.
