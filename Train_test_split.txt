suppose we use different machine learning algorithms .
evaluate the performance of each of them.

	logistic regression: 91%
	SVM: 56%
	Random Forest: 97%


The distribution of samples in X_train and test is not uniform.
So whenever we'll execute these algorithms the score will get changed.

On reexecution the samples in x_train,test y train test got changed 

what accuracy we should show our stakeholders?

performing cross validation will help 


in k-fold cross validation
