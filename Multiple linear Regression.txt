			MLR

used to predict the outcome variable based on the value of two or more variables.

MLR analyses how multiple independent variables are related to the dependent variable.


y= 0+1 X1+2 X2+………+n Xn

y = the predicted value of the dependent variable
0 = the y-intercept (value of y when all other parameters are set to 0)
1 X1 = the regression coefficient (1) of the first independent variable (X1) (a.k.a. the effect that increasing the value of the independent variable has on the predicted y value).
n Xn = the regression coefficient of the last independent variable



Multiple Linear Regression Assumptions:

1.Observation Independence:
	If two independent variables are too strongly correlated ,only one of the should
be used in the regression model.

2. Homogeneity of variance:
	The magnitutde of the predictions error does not vary significantly across the values
		of the independent variables.

3. Linearity :
	The best-fit line going through the data points is a straight line, not a curve or grouping
