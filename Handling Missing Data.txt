Questionn: what should be the order after getting the raw data


	feature engineering
	Feature Selection
	Model Creation
	Hyperparameter Tuning
	Model deployement
	Incremental Learning

unprocessed data must be containing 
	
	Missing values
	OUtliers
	Unstructured Manner
	Imbalanced data
	Categorical Data


Feature Engineering Steps:
	1. Exploratory Data Analysis
	2. Handling Missing Values
	3. Handling Imbalanced Data
	4. Handling Outliers
	5. Scaling down the data ( Standardiation and Normalization)
	6. Converting categorical data into Numerical data(One hot encoding or Label Encoding)
	7. Feature Extraction.

Questions:

why is there missing data?


Mean/Meadian/mode Imputation(taking charge)

Mean:- It is the average value.

Median :- It is the midjoint value.

Mode:- most common value 





Mean :- It is preferred if data is numeric and not skewed.

Median :- data is numeric and skewed.

Mode :- data is String(object) or numeric.



Disadvantage:

1. Change in the original variance.
2.It impacts the correlation.




---Below are some of the techniques of detecting outliers---

	1.Boxplots
	2.Z-score
	3.Inter Quantile Range(IQR)
