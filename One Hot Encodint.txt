One-hot encoding

	One-hot encoding converts the categorical data into numeric data by splitting the column into multiple columns. 

	The numbers are replaced by 1s and 0s, depending on which column has what value.



Label encoding

	This approach is very simple and it involves converting each value in a column into a number.


When to use One-Hot encoding and Label encoding?

Label encoder is used when:

		The number of categories is quite large as one-hot encoding can lead to high memory consumption.
		When the order does not matter in categorical feature.


One Hot encoder is used when:

		When the order does not matter in categorical features
		Categories in a feature are fewer.
