The neuron in each layer extract and combine features from the data, 
and the neural network learns to map the features to the desired output
 through a training process that adjust the weights of the connections between
 the neurons.


can be used in
	classification 
	regression
	predicition

architectures 
	feedforward n/w
	cnn
	rnn




Why it is called as BlackBox?

 	deep neural networks, we don't know how all the individual neurons work 
	together to arrive at the final output.
